# Password-Generator Game

This is a Password Generator program written in Python that creates a strong and customizable password based on user preferences. It allows users to specify the number of numbers, alphabets, and symbols they want in their password, ensuring a mix of characters for better security.

How It Works:

1. The user inputs the desired number of numbers, alphabets, and symbols in the password.
2. The program randomly selects characters from predefined lists of letters, numbers (0-9), and symbols to build the password.
3. The characters are then shuffled to make the password more secure and less predictable.
4. The final password is displayed on the screen.

This tool is useful for generating strong passwords that are harder to guess, enhancing security for online accounts and sensitive information.
